The AdverseEvent resource also extends to potential or avoided events that could have had such effects. There are two major domains where the AdverseEvent resource is expected to be used. One is in clinical care reported adverse events and the other is in reporting adverse events in clinical  research trial management.  Adverse events can be reported by healthcare providers, patients, caregivers or by medical products manufacturers.  Given the differences between these two concepts, we recommend consulting the domain specific implementation guides when implementing the AdverseEvent Resource. The implementation guides include specific extensions, value sets and constraints.</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>\n                      <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-AuditEvent\">AuditEvent</a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>AuditEvent</td>\n                    <td>A record of an event relevant for purposes such as operations, privacy, security, maintenance, and performance analysis.</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>\n                      <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-ChargeItem\">ChargeItem</a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>ChargeItem</td>\n                    <td>The resource ChargeItem describes the provision of healthcare provider products for a certain patient, therefore referring not only to the product, but containing in addition details of the provision, like date, time, amounts and participating organizations and persons.

A common scenario where this information is captured is during the history taking process during a patient visit or stay.   The medication information may come from sources such as the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle,  or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains. \n\nThe primary difference between a medicationstatement and a medicationadministration is that the medication administration has complete administration information and is based on actual administration information from the person who administered the medication.  A medicationstatement is often, if not always, less specific.  There is no required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported the patient is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or missing or less precise.  As stated earlier, the Medication Statement information may come from the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.  Medication administration is more formal and is not missing detailed information.</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>\n                      <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-MessageHeader\">MessageHeader</a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>MessageHeader</td>\n                    <td>The header for a message exchange that is either requesting or responding to an action.

A common scenario where this information is captured is during the history taking process during a patient visit or stay or through an app that tracks food or fluids consumed.   The consumption information may come from sources such as the patient's memory, from a nutrition label,  or from a clinician documenting observed intake.</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>\n                      <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-Observation\">Observation</a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>Observation</td>\n                    <td>Measurements and simple assertions made about a patient, device or other subject.</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>\n                      <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-PaymentNotice\">PaymentNotice</a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>PaymentNotice</td>\n                    <td>This resource provides the status of the payment for goods and services rendered, and the request and response resource references.</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>\n                      <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-PaymentReconciliation\">PaymentReconciliation</a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>PaymentReconciliation</td>\n                    <td>This resource provides the details including amount of a payment and allocates the payment items being paid.</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>\n                      <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-Procedure\">Procedure</a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>Procedure</td>\n                    <td>An action that is or was performed on or for a patient, practitioner, device, organization, or location.
