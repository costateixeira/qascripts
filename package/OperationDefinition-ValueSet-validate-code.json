'abstract' is a property defined by many HL7 code systems that indicates that the concept is a logical grouping concept that is not intended to be used as a 'concrete' concept to in an actual patient/care/process record.

However in the general record and terminology eco-system, there are many contexts where it is appropriate to use these codes e.g. as decision making criterion, or when editing value sets themselves.
