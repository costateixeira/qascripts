The AdverseEvent resource also extends to potential or avoided events that could have had such effects. There are two major domains where the AdverseEvent resource is expected to be used. One is in clinical care reported adverse events and the other is in reporting adverse events in clinical  research trial management.  Adverse events can be reported by healthcare providers, patients, caregivers or by medical products manufacturers.  Given the differences between these two concepts, we recommend consulting the domain specific implementation guides when implementing the AdverseEvent Resource. The implementation guides include specific extensions, value sets and constraints.</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>\n                      <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-AllergyIntolerance\">AllergyIntolerance</a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>AllergyIntolerance</td>\n                    <td>Risk of harmful or undesirable, physiological response which is unique to an individual and associated with exposure to a substance.</td>\n                  </tr>\n                  <tr>\n                    <td>\n                      <a href=\"codesystem-fhir-types.html#fhir-types-Appointment\">Appointment</a>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>Appointment</td>\n                    <td>A booking of a healthcare event among patient(s), practitioner(s), related person(s) and/or device(s) for a specific date/time.

As stated earlier, the Medication Statement information may come from the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.
