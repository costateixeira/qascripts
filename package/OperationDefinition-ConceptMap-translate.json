Note that the list of matches may include notes of codes for which mapping is specifically excluded (i.e. 'not-related-to'), so implementers have to check the target.relationship for each match. If a source* parameter is provided, the $translate operation will return all matches whereby the provided source concept is the source of a mapping relationship (in a specified ConceptMap or otherwise known to the server). If a target* parameter is provided, the $translate operation will return all matches whereby the provided target concept is the target of a mapping relationship (in a specified ConceptMap or otherwise known to the server). Note: The source value set is an optional parameter because in some cases, the client cannot know what the source value set is. However, without a source value set, the server may be unable to safely identify an applicable concept map, and would return an error. For this reason, a source value set SHOULD always be provided. Note that servers may be able to identify an appropriate concept map without a source value set if there is a full mapping for the entire code system in the concept map, or by manual intervention.","jurisdiction":[{"coding":[{"system":"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm","code":"001","display":"World"}]}],"affectsState":false,"code":"translate","resource":["ConceptMap"],"system":false,"type":true,"instance":true,"parameter":[{"name":"url","use":"in","scope":["type"],"min":0,"max":"1","documentation":"A canonical URL for a concept map.
